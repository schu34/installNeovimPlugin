# Install Neovim Plugin

the simplest possible way to install a neovim plugin. Assuming the plugin can be found on github, and assuming that Neovim was installed via `brew install neovim`, find code on github and run the command

```
./installNvimPlugin.sh <url of RAW code>

```

For example to install surround.vim we would use

```
/installNvimPlugin.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-surround/master/plugin/surround.vim

```
